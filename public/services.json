    "about": "Before you get to expressing your ideas on a paper, brainstorm for the ideas. If you’re now preparing for the exam, write every idea that comes to your mind. (Don’t worry if your mind goes blank, there is a tutorial for that here) Write them on a separate sheet of paper. During the exam, your time will be limited. Therefore, the more you train in generating ideas, the easier and faster you’ll complete the task when time comes. Don’t worry if you don’t like some ideas, you don’t necessarily have to include all of them in your future essay. Making a mind map with words or short phrases related to the topic is a great idea as well."
